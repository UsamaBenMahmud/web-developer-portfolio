Web Development Portfolio
Welcome to my personal web development portfolio! This project showcases my skills in building responsive and aesthetically pleasing websites using HTML and CSS.

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to create clean, well-structured, and user-friendly websites, without the use of complex JavaScript frameworks or back-end technologies. It's a static website that focuses on strong front-end fundamentals.

Feel free to explore the code and see how Iâ€™ve applied responsive design principles, CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid, and clean, semantic HTML to create an accessible web experience.
